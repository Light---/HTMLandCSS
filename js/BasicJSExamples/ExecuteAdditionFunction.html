<!-- html is a markup langauge, which implies that it deals primarily with text. Here, 
we introduce the idea of "tags" and give the least amount of html code to run your javascript
Addition.js function.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<!--DOCtYPE tells the computer that we are using modern html-->

<html>
<!--angled brackets that "sandwhich" some text indicate a tag. Here, we are tagging our
following code as html. This is the first tag in every html file that you will ever write.-->
<head>
<!--This is the head tag. You can load all of the information that you will need in the head tag, as we
will do. -->
	<script type="text/javascript" src="Addition.js">
	</script> <!--close script tag-->
<!--Here we tell our machine that we would like to write a script (some code). We indicate that the text should
be reas as "type" Javascript(type="text/javascript"). Because we have already written our code, and it is located
within the same directory, we tell the machine that the source(src) of our code is located in Addition.js 
(src="Addition.js")

</head> <!--close head tag-->
<body>
<!-- The body tag is where everything "fun happens". For our purposes, we will only our JavaScript Code-->
	<script type= "text/javascript">
	document.write(Addition(2,5))
</script> <!-- end script tag-->
<!-- We have declared another script tag of type JavaScript. Because we have already loaded our function with the 
previous in the previous script tag, we are free to use it. We do so by writing Addition(a,b) where a and b have 
been choosen arbitrarily. In order to display the output of Addition(2,5), we enclose it in the document.write()
function, which will display the output of Addition(2,5).
